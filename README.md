Your boss, the Chief Technical Officer Katie Ledecky, wants you to come up with a proposal to replace all Windows XP systems with Linux. You will research and select the Linux distribution of choice and justify why you picked it.

Requirements

In addition the requirements in the grading rubric, the final submission should contain at least 5 to 7 pages worth of text written by the student (not counting title page, images, diagrams, tables, or quotations that may be used), but may be longer, not to exceed approximately 7 pages’ worth of student-supplied text.

You must turn this assignment to both the assignment area within our LEO classroom as well as to the TurnItIn website. Failure to do so may result in point deductions. Follow the TurnItIn instructions provided within the class.

You must address the following in your proposal and may make any assumptions which are not specified:

· Research and justify whether Medals will use existing computer hardware that is being used with the Windows XP systems, or if new hardware will be required.

· Plan for migration from Windows XP to Linux.

· Explain how some windows services can interact with Linux services during the transition.

o Printing

o File Sharing

o DNS

o Central Authentication

· Determine the hardware to be used and the installation options.

· How will users log onto the systems? Explain.

· How will systems receive IP addresses? Explain.

· How will DNS be accessed by the Medals systems? Where will DNS be hosted and how with the Linux systems be configured to use it?

· How will central authentication be handled in the Linux environment.

· How will printing be handled? Explain.
